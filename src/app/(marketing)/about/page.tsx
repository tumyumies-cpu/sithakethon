          College campuses, hostels, and restaurants regularly generate surplus food, but there is no structured system to track excess quantities or quickly connect providers with NGOs or shelters that need it. This results in edible food being wasted while communities go hungry.
        </p>
        <p>
          PlatePal was founded to solve this problem. We are a trustworthy, easy-to-use platform that connects restaurants, hostels and campus messes with NGOs and volunteer drivers to redistribute surplus food fast, safely and transparently — with donation options and tokenized incentives.
